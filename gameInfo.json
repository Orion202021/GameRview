It is the successor to Victory Goal and was later followed by three more titles: Sega Worldwide Soccer \u002798 still on the 32-bit console and two editions of Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000, the second being Sega Worldwide Soccer 2000 Euro Edition for the Dreamcast.\n\nSega Worldwide Soccer 97, produced by Sega themselves was one of the killer apps in the peak of popularity for the console. It was preceded by Victory Goal, an already ageing football game (one of the debut titles of the console). The game featured international teams and league, play-off and tournament modes. Although it used fictional player names (due to the lack of a license), the non-volatile memory of the Saturn allowed editing of names. The team kits were as close to the official 1996 kits as possible. The gameplay was also highly praised, and was the top-rated football game until ISS 64 was released one year later. Sega Worldwide Soccer 97 was later ported to the PC, under the title of Sega Worldwide Soccer PC."

Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\n\nRules\n\nConstruction and layout:\n\n* One standard 52-card deck is used.\n* There are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\n* Cards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\n\nBuilding during play:\n\n* The top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\n* Tableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\n* Foundations are built up by suit.\n\nMoves:\n\n* Any cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\n* Complete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. While computer implementations often show this motion, players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\n\nVictory:\n\n* The game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\n\nFor games with the standard layout (four open cells and eight cascades) most games are easily solved.\n\nSupported Operations:\n* Tap one column and tap another column, move the cards from the first column to second column if possible;\n* Double Tap on the column\u0027s last card to move it to buffer area, if possible;\n* Drag cards from one column to another column, if possible;\n* Auto throw, cards will be throw to recycle automatically, if possible;\n* Drag from recycle to columns to restore the recycled card, if possible;\n\nWith Auto-throw, it is much more convenient to finish the card puzzle!\nEnjoy it, players!"

When the solar explosions died, the humans decide to return to Earth. When the Kat Men refuse to leave, a war droid known as MT-ED, or Multi Terrain Exploration Droid, is sent down to deal with the Kat Men. Accompanying him is Hercules 1, a maintenance and combat droid. When the two droids are beamed down, things take a turn for the worse. Hercules is kidnapped and taken far away to the Kat Men\u0027s Nerve Center. It is MT-ED\u0027s task to get rid of the Kat Men and rescue Hercules. \n \nTo do this, MT-ED has to explore fourteen environments and deal with deadly creatures that are within each environment, with each type of creature requiring a certain type of weapon to be defeated. These weapons - including lasers, water bombs, grenades, and rockets - can be picked up along the way, and MT-ED can switch between them with ease. If MT-ED comes into contact with any of the creatures, he is kicked into the air and gets stunned for a few seconds. If this happens, he loses one of his lives. Not all creatures are deadly; some of them will steal whatever weapons MT-ED is carrying at the time. \n \nBesides using weapons to kill, MT-ED also has the ability to jump over creatures that may be too slow for him to shoot. When MT-ED finally rescues Hercules, a sub-game needs to be completed. When MT-ED completed this sub-game, the Kat Men\u0027s Central Computer is disabled and the Kat Men go back where they came from."

An agency that investigates murders that the authorities have deemed unsolvable. While working on several, seemingly unrelated cases, you find clues pointing to the person who killed your parents. Can you stop this new cycle of death before it\u0027s too late?\n\nKazuki\u0027s partners include the crazy and funny Ishikawa Siblings; Kaoru Moriyama, the daughter of a millionaire and founder of the organization; and Suzumi Misao, the head of the organization.\nWith a delightfully quirky cast, players will form bonds with the main characters while trying to solve the overarching case of the Phantom Killer, a criminal with a perfect track record.\n\nCurrent and Upcoming Features:\nWith around 30 hours playtime and dialogue partially voiced in English, Bloody Chronicles is divided into five action-packed chapters.\nThroughout your pursuit of the Phantom Killer, you must make serveral decisions that determine the novel\u0027s outcome. Players that enjoy replay value can expect around 70 possible decisions to explore, some of which will even influence Kazuki\u0027s \"romantic\" relationship with his female colleagues at Igrasil.\n\nAs for adult content in Bloody Chronicles, four unlockable episodes called \"IF mode\" are releasing soon and will feature Igrasil members Aki, Suzumi, Kaoru, and Akito. Alongside that, a beach-themed episode that is sure to offer plenty of fan service.\n\nBeyond that Bloody Chronicles Act 2 \u0026 3.\""
