mario_description = "Peace has returned to the Mushroom Kingdom thanks to the efforts of Mario and Luigi; however, Bowser sent his own seven \
            children (Larry, Morton, Wendy, Iggy, Roy, Lemmy, and Ludwig) to the other countries of the Mushroom World. The Mushroom \
            Kingdom forms a gateway to these lands, and the Koopalings have stolen the respective royal magic wands of the seven kings, \
            using them to transform the kings into various helpless creatures. Mario and Luigi vow to go and stop the Koopalings' mischief, \
            and change the kings back into their normal form. At the end of each world, Mario and Luigi fight one of the Koopalings, and \
            after the match is over, retrieve the wand from the Koopaling to turn the king back to normal. While the brothers are out \
            in their adventure, Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool and takes her to his lair in Dark Land. The brothers go to Dark Land \
            and fight Bowser. After defeating Bowser, they save the princess and restore peace once again."
